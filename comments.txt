# Structure


I have added Usecase, and DataSourse classes to centralised data logic, reusability, modularity and any kind of error handle from the internal layer. As a result, It makes the architecture more productive, particularly when used in a view model. The API level exceptions, HTTP exceptions, and object casting issues will be handled in here.


Moreover, this layer will make the flow and coroutine management more standard.
Several components, including BroadcastReceiver and Singltone, have been used to meet the condition.




# Testing


- TODO test units are done
- I have added a few UI Testing


# Design


- I followed the Figma file.


# Suggestions


As far as everything was great. A personal image can be added and a detail screen. As a test project, the skeleton structure was well-defined and easy to understand.


Thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in this test.
